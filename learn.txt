Certainly! To create a new repository on GitHub, follow these easiest steps:

### Step 1: Install Git
If you haven't already installed Git on your computer, you can download it from [git-scm.com]
Websites:: (https://git-scm.com/)
For Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Open the command line.
Set your username: git config --global user.name "your--username"
Set your email address: git config --global user.email "your--githubemail"

FOR CHECKING
git config --list

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/).

### Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and choose "New repository."
3. Fill in the repository name as "Your Project Name/Your Folder Name" and add a description if you want.
4. Choose to initialize this repository with a README file.
5. Click "Create repository."

### Step 4: Clone the Repository
Now, let's clone the repository to your local machine.

```Open VS CODE 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/How-To-Use-Github.git
cd How-To-Use-Github
```

Replace "your-username" with your GitHub username.

### Step 5: Create a Basic Project
Create a simple project or add some files to the local repository. For example, let's create a file named `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>How-To-Use-Github</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, GitHub!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 6: Add, 
            Commit, 
            and 
            Push Changes
```IN VS TERMINAL
git add .
git commit -m "MESSAGE LIKE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LATEST WORK"
git push origin main
```

Replace "main" with "master" if you're using an older Git version.

### Step 7: Open the Repository in VS Code
If you haven't installed Visual Studio Code, download and install it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Open VS Code and navigate to your project folder:

```bash
code .
```

### Step 8: Make Changes and Push from VS Code
Edit the `index.html` file in VS Code. Save the changes.

1. Go to the Source Control tab.
2. Review the changes and stage them.
3. Add a commit message and click the checkmark to commit.
4. Click the ellipsis (...) and choose "Push" to push the changes to GitHub.

That's it! You've now created a GitHub repository, cloned it to your local machine, made changes, and pushed them back to GitHub using VS Code.
